# 🚀 kiruhi — Code. Automate. Build.

This isn’t another repo.  
This is a **sandbox for ideas that shouldn’t work… but somehow do.**

If you like:
- weird automation experiments  
- Python/JS scripts that save hours  
- AI tools used in “not intended” ways  
- scrapers, bots, micro-projects  
- and fast prototypes that turn into real products  

…welcome in. ⚡

Every folder = a project.  
Every project = something you can clone and use today.

### Why exist?
To build things faster than excuses.

### Start here
`/projects` → real code  
`/automation` → scripts  
`/ai-lab` → agents & experiments  
`/templates` → ready-to-use tools

**Stay curious. Break things. Ship fast.**
